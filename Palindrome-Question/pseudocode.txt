Develop a tool that evaluates whether a given phrase or word can be read the 
 same way forwards and backwards, considering common variations and noise such 
 as spaces and punctuation.

Input  -  String
Process  -   Create a function that takes the input string as a parameter
             Convert the input to lowercase
             Remove all spaces and special characters
             Initialize a variable that holds the clean string 
             Reverse the clean string
             compare the clean string with the reversed clean string 
             If they are equal the string can be read the same ways forward and backwards
             If they are not equal the string can't be read the same ways forward and backwards
Output   -  Boolean
